$$ s_t = \frac{S_t}{N} $$

$$ i_t = \frac{I_t}{N} $$

$$ r_t = \frac{R_t}{N} $$

Test multiline alignment of functions:

$$\begin{align*}
S \rightarrow I \rightarrow R && S(t)&=\text{number that are susceptible at time }t&&s(t)=S(t)/N\\
 && I(t)&=\text{number that are infected}&&i(t)=I(t)/N\\
  && R(t)&=\text{number that are recovered or dead}&&r(t)=R(t)/N\\
  \end{align*}$$
